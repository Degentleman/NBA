# NBA-PBP-Data
Script for parsing PBP Data

This is a Python script I'm working on for NBA play-by-play data. My goal is to be able to parse an array of play-by-play data for a given matchup of two teams and build an adversarial synergy graph, which builds pathways between nodes of agents--in this case, NBA players--to model how the players on the same team perform relative to their interactions with players on the opposing team. 

Here's the research paper that prompted me to attempt to write this script:

Any feedback is welcome!
